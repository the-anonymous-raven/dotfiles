Dotfiles for my workflow on reddit

Fonts that I commonly use:
- Quicksand

- Material Design Fonts[for the beautiful material icons]

Bar: polybar [https://github.com/polybar/polybar]

Window manager: Bspwm [https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm]

Compositor: Picom [ibhagawan fork for getting rounded corners on bspwm] ->https://github.com/ibhagwan/picom

- Add more beautiful wallpapers.
- Multiple theme modes with different wallpapers, keybindings[sxhkd] and different polybars.
- Css for my beautiful firefox setup.
